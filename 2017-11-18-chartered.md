**Chartered accountants work in all fields of business and finance, including audit, taxation, financial and general management**. Some are engaged in public practice work, others work in the private sector and some are employed by government bodies.[2][3][4]

**Chartered accountants' institutes require members to undertake a minimum level of continuing professional development to stay professionally competitive**. They facilitate special interest groups (for instance, entertainment and media, or insolvency and restructuring) which lead in their fields.
