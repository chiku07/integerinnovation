Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports **multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library**.[26]

Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. **CPython**, the reference implementation of Python, is **open source software**[27] and has a **community-based development model**, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. **CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation**.
