The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by **Sun under proprietary licenses**. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its Java technologies under the **GNU General Public License**. Others have also developed alternative implementations of these **Sun technologies**, such as the **GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets)**.
